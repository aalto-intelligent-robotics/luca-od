                Accurate maps are a prerequisite for virtually all mobile robot tasks. Most state-of-the-art maps assume a static world;
                therefore, dynamic objects are filtered out of the measurements. However, this division ignores movable but
                non-moving---i.e., semi-static---objects, which are usually recorded in the map and treated as static objects, violating
                the static world assumption and causing errors in the localization. This paper presents a method for consistently
                modeling moving and movable objects to match the map and measurements. This reduces the error resulting from
                inconsistent categorization and treatment of non-static measurements. A semantic segmentation network is used to
                categorize the measurements into static and semi-static classes, and a background subtraction filter is used to remove
                dynamic measurements. Finally, we show that consistent assumptions over dynamics improve localization accuracy when
                compared against a state-of-the-art baseline solution using real-world data from the Oxford Radar RobotCar data set.
